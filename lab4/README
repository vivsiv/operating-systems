sample_log.txt - My sample log out put from running my program until the server told it to shut off

My implementation polls the socket before taking a reading to see if there are any pending updates,
if there are it applies them to the current reading. The one exception is frequency, which it applies
to the next reading because it has already slept as many seconds as the previous frequency before
getting this update.
